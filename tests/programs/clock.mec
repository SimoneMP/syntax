# Clock

Create a timer that ticks every second. This is the time source.
  #system/timer = [resolution: 1000, tick: 0, hours: 2, minutes: 32, seconds: 47]

Set up a clock hands table. Degrees is the deflection from noon.
x and y are the coordinates of the end point of the clock hand.
  #clock-hands = [|degrees length stroke    x y |
                   0       30     "#023963" 0 0
                   0       40     "#023963" 0 0
                   0       40     "#ce0b46" 0 0 ]

## Update the clock

Calculate clock hand angles every time the clock ticks.
  ~ #system/timer.tick 
  time = [#system/timer.hours; #system/timer.minutes; #system/timer.seconds]
  multiplier = [30; 6; 6]
  #clock-hands.degrees := multiplier * time
  
Calculate x and y endpoints
  angle = #clock-hands.degrees
  #clock-hands.x := 50 + (30 * math/sin(degrees: angle))
  #clock-hands.y := 50 - (30 * math/cos(degrees: angle))
